                    <p>A <a target='_blank' href='https://theironthrone.net'>The Iron Throne</a> instance with South Korean meta designs available and implemented to play in the browser.</p>
                    <p> This site is not maintained by the original The Iron Throne team, and it is not meant to substitute the original site.</p>

                    <h3>That's pretty cool!  But how does any of this work?</h3>
                    <p>Head on over to the <Link href='/how-to-play'>How To Play guide</Link> for a thorough explanation.</p>

                    <h3>Everyone has a shiny avatar, how do I get one?</h3>
                    <p>This is handled by the good people at <a href='http://gravatar.com' target='_blank'>Gravatar</a>.  Sign up there with the same email address you did there and it should appear on the site after a short while.
                It will also use the avatar on any site that uses gravatar.  Examples include github and jinteki.</p>

                    <h3>The artwork on this site is pretty cool, where's that from?</h3>
                    <p>You're right, it is pretty nice isn't it?</p>
